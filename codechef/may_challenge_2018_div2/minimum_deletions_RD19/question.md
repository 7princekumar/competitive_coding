Question:
Find the minimum number of elements which have to be deleted so that the GCD of the resulting sequence would be equal to 1, or determine that it is impossible.

Input: 
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of elements to delete, or −1 if it is impossible to make the GCD equal to 1.
